Based on these, which are considered the ground-truth, but take considerable computational resources to compute, a surrogate model (also called meta-model) is created that maps the input-output relationships of the full simulation pipeline. This low-complexity model can be used to gain insights on high-dimensional parameter dependencies at low computational cost, and for further applications such as surrogate-based optimization, model-based control, uncertainty quantification...</p> <p>Nonetheless, before using a surrogate model, the user is encouraged to inspect its quality-of-fit, and validate whether it is a suitable approximation of the simulation pipeline. In order to do so, a technique known as Cross-Validation is used, by which a surrogate model is fitted with a portion of the data. Then, the data that was hidden during training (validation set) is used to perform predictions and compare to the real simulated values. This procedure is performed multiple times, until all samples have been used once in the validation set. Comparing the predictions on all samples to their real simulated values provides a lower-bound confidence on the accuracy of the final surrogate model, which will be trained with all samples.</p> <p>In the first visualization of the Response Modeling HyperTool, a violin plot is displayed, which compares the sample values and distributions of the full-simulation observations versus their cross-validation predictions. Similar distributions, as well as low mean error at the per-sample level, indicates a good quality-of-fit.</p> <p>Furthermore, the mean and standard deviation of both the observations and the predictions' distribution is displayed, together with the per-sample Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Comparing these error metrics with the data distribution values can provide an idea of the magnitude of the prediction errors compared to the variance present in the data.</p> <p> The violin plot provides a tool to validate whether the distribution of cross-validation predictions matches that of the ground-truth observations. Moreover, we can compare the scale of the MAE (~4e-3) with the scale of variance in the data (standard deviation ~ 4e-2), showing that prediction error is only ~10% the variability in the data distribution, further strengthening the visual impression of the violin plot that the surrogate model is appropriately fitting the underlying observations.</p> <p>Once the surrogate model has been deemed appropriately well fitted, it is time to use it to gain insights into the outputs' (QoI) dependencies on the input parameters. For that purpose, visualizations based on one, two, or three simultaneous parameters can be seamlessly and efficiently generated through the Response Surface Modeling HyperTool. Please click the \"Next\" button to move to the 1D Curves visualization tool.</p> <p>High-Dimensional Visualization</p> <p>Please note that the data (and the surrogate model fitted to it) is N-dimensional (with N=4 in this tutorial) - which is not possible to visualize. Nonetheless, it is possible to examine lower-dimensional \"slices\" or \"cross-sections\" of the model (i.e. by fixing the value of some of the parameters in order to obtain lower-dimensional predictions). These slices, while not able to capture the dependencies on the fixed value parameters, can provide very valuable information on the parameter dependencies displayed. Moreover, by interactively changing the values assigned to the fixed parameters, it is possible to also gain an understanding on their role, both towards the output and their possibly complex interplay with other parameters. Therefore, lower-dimensional visualizations can still allow to gain deep understanding of parameter dependencies of the broader, high-dimensional model.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/response-surface-modeling-tutorial/#1d-curve-response","title":"1D Curve Response","text":"<p>In the 1D Curves visualization tool, the X axis represents the range of values of the selected input parameter (selectable at the \"Axis\" dropdown below the graph), while the Y axis represents the values of the QoI of choice (selectable at the top select box).</p> <p>Gaussian Process Confidence</p> <p>Gaussian Processes (GP), also known as Kriging, are used as surrogate models.

While the uncertainty bands appear relatively wide, they represent a high degree of confidence (95%) on a full-simulation sample lying within the shadowed range, following a normal (Gaussian) distribution around the predicted value.

Low angle widths (e.g. low coverage of the nerve) naturally result in difficulties to stimulate enough fibers, while it seems to flatten from ~120\u00ba - further coverage does not necessarily facilitate stimulation, once the electrode is in close proximity to enough fibers. Minima are observed at ~200\u00ba and ~250\u00ba, which could indicate proximity to a more superficial fascicle. However, the low relative magnitude of these changes advises caution, as these variations might very well be within the uncertainty associated to the surrogate model and therefore not necessarily reflect a real low-amplitude variation in the modeled simulation pipeline.

This is a critical requirement for regulatory submission and clinical translation of bioelectronic devices. This capability allows engineers and researchers to efficiently demonstrate the statistical reliability of their designs across physiologically relevant parameter ranges. </p> <p>Traditional sensitivity analysis focuses on sweeps over single uncertain variables to determine their effect on the quantity of interest - investigating the interplay between multiple uncertain parameters quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of input parameters increases - the required number of samples is # samples per parameter ^ (# parameters). Using a very minimal 3 samples per parameter for the six parameters in this tutorial, that would already imply over 700 samples.</p> <p>The Uncertainty Quantification HyperTool uses an alternative approach:</p> <ol> <li>A low density sampling of the parameter space is generated (50 samples in this tutorial - equivalent to 1.92 samples per dimension)</li> <li>A surrogate model is fitted to the simulated data (observations).</li> <li>This surrogate model can be used to very efficiently evaluate a high-density sampling of the input parameter space (Number of UQ Samples, 10,000 by default) according to the statistical distributions specified by the user. </li> <li>A histogram of all propagated samples is assembled, producing a rigorous statistical description of the output quantity, accounting for complex interplays between (possibly non-linear) parameters.</li> </ol> <p>This methodology provides a more solid uncertainty estimation than the combination of multiple traditional single-parameter sensitivity analyses.</p> <p> The Uncertainty Quantification Histogram provides a rigorous statistical description of the output quantity of interest, accounting for non-linear parameter dependencies and parameter interplay. Here, the distribution of the values of the Shannon Criteria at 50% current threshold isopercentile (i.e. the current [mA] value at which 50% of the fibers in the nerve have been activated) provides a statistical description of the safety of the implantable device. The mean (-2.23) is, as could be expected, close the value predicted for the optimal design parameters (-2.24) in the previous tutorial. Its shape is approximately Gaussian. Importantly, its standard deviation (0.066) is ~3% of the mean value (-2.23), even though all input parameter distributions were given a standard deviation 20% of their mean value. This implies that the safety of the stimulation is stable and not highly influenced by tissue conductivities, which increases its reliability and potential for regulatory approval.</p> <p>Additionally, the Uncertainty Propagation Histogram provides error bars associated with the uncertainty propagation process itself - multiple (50) runs of stochastic sampling of the underlying Gaussian Process are used to assess whether the propagated uncertainty distribution has converged.

Additionally, one / two / three dimensional visualizations of parameter influence on outputs can be utilized to gain further insights on which are the most relevant parameters, and therefore their uncertainty will be more impactful on the final result. For a full description of these visualizations, please refer to the previous tutorial or to the Manual.</p> <p> The distribution of simulated data (observations) and surrogate predictions are highly aligned, with a per-sample mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.4e-3 - approximately ~10% of the standard deviation in the data, 7.5e-2.
