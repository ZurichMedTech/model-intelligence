.. admonition:: Model Intelligence: A Paradigm Shift in Simulation Analysis

  Model Intelligence represents a transformative approach to understanding complex simulation models. By creating simplified mathematical representations of computationally intensive simulations, meta-modeling enables rapid exploration of parameter spaces that would otherwise require thousands of time-consuming simulations. This "model intelligence" approach empowers users to gain deeper insights into parameter sensitivities, optimize designs efficiently, quantify uncertainties, and make data-driven decisions with unprecedented speed. For bioelectronic applications, where biological variability and design parameters interact in complex ways, meta-modeling transforms raw simulation data into actionable knowledgeâ€”revealing relationships between inputs and outcomes that might remain hidden in traditional simulation approaches. The techniques you'll learn in this tutorial represent a major advancement in simulation analysis, allowing you to extract maximum value from your models while dramatically reducing computational overhead.
