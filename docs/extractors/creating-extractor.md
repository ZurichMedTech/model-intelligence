# Creating an Extractor

This guide walks you through the process of creating a custom result extractor for your Sim4Life plugin. Extractors are responsible for visualizing and analyzing simulation results, providing users with meaningful insights into the physics simulations.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an extractor, ensure you have:

- A working solver that produces result files (typically VTK format)
- An understanding of the physical quantities your simulation produces

## Extractor Structure


## Next Steps

Once you have a working extractor, consider:

- Adding more visualization types (cut planes, volume rendering, etc.)
- Implementing more sophisticated data analysis
- Creating custom UI widgets for interactive exploration
- Supporting time-dependent data and animations
