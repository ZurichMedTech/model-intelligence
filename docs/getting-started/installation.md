# Introduction

Welcome to the Sim4Life Plugin Framework documentation.

## Requirements

To develop and run plugins with Sim4Life, you need:

- Appropriate Sim4Life modeling and postprocessing licenses.
- Basic infrastructure for Python development (API into Sim4Life)

## Sim4Life Framework Application

For plugin development and management, we provide a standalone application called **Sim4Life Framework**. This tool allows you to:

- Develop your own plugins.
- Install and use plugins from other contributors.

For this purpose, we have made code-server available with pre-installed extensions for Python development, as well as a specialized extension tailored for Sim4Life plugin development.

Code-server is a browser-based version of Visual Studio Code that allows you to develop and manage your plugins directly from your web browser, without needing to install any software locally. This makes it easy to get started and ensures a consistent development environment across all platforms.



## Availability

The Sim4Life Framework is available in several Sim4Life platforms:

- **s4l-lite.io**: The free version of Sim4Life, ideal for getting started.
- **sim4life.io**: The commercial Sim4Life platform.
- **sim4life.science**: The academic version for research and education.

For information on obtaining an account and accessing these platforms, visit [sim4life.swiss](https://sim4life.swiss).
