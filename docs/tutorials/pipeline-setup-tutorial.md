The example pipeline focuses on a neural implant designed for sural nerve pain relief - a chronic pain condition that affects many patients. The pipeline demonstrates how complex bioelectronic simulations can be structured to support comprehensive design optimization and analysis through Model Intelligence tools.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Pipeline Workbench Overview

The Sim4Life Web pipeline workbench provides a visual interface for constructing computational workflows. For the sural nerve implant example, the workspace includes three main categories of components:

1. **Input parameters** for electrode design parameters, tissue conductivities, and simulation parameters
2. **Computational nodes** which build the model, perform simulations, and extract numerical results
3. **Output probes** for resulting output metrics (quantities-of-interest, QoIs)
