- **Navigate interactive visualizations** effectively
- **Extract design insights** from complex parameter relationships
- **Make informed engineering decisions** based on statistical analysis

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with simulation and modeling concepts
- Understanding of parameter studies and sensitivity analysis

## Tutorial Data

The tutorials use pre-computed data from bioelectronic device simulations, specifically focusing on neural stimulation and pain relief applications. This allows you to explore all analysis functionalities without needing to run computationally intensive simulations.

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with the **Pipeline Setup Tutorial** to understand how simulation workflows are structured for Model Intelligence analysis. This foundation is essential for effectively using all HyperTools.

After understanding the pipeline architecture, you can explore the analysis tutorials in any order based on your objectives:
- **Response Surface Modeling** for detailed parameter dependency analysis
- **Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA)** for systematic optimization of competing objectives
- **Uncertainty Quantification** for statistical robustness assessment

For a comprehensive workflow, the combination of MOGA optimization for design discovery, RSM for detailed analysis, and UQ for robustness assessment provides complete Model Intelligence capabilities for advanced bioelectronic device development.

All analysis tutorials use the same underlying simulation model but demonstrate different analysis approaches, showing how the same pipeline can provide complementary insights depending on your engineering objectives.
