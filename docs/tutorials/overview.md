2. **Setup Configuration**: Step-by-step HyperTool configuration
3. **Analysis Workflow**: Interactive exploration techniques
4. **Results Interpretation**: How to extract actionable insights
5. **Design Decisions**: Applying results to engineering decisions

## Learning Objectives

After completing these tutorials, you will be able to:

- **Configure HyperTools** for your own simulation pipelines
- **Interpret surrogate model quality** and validation metrics
- **Navigate interactive visualizations** effectively
- **Extract design insights** from complex parameter relationships
- **Make informed engineering decisions** based on statistical analysis

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with simulation and modeling concepts
- Understanding of parameter studies and sensitivity analysis

## Tutorial Data

The tutorials use pre-computed data from bioelectronic device simulations, specifically focusing on neural stimulation and pain relief applications. This allows you to explore all analysis functionalities without needing to run computationally intensive simulations.

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with the Response Surface Modeling tutorial to understand the fundamental concepts. You can then explore either the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) tutorial to learn about simultaneous optimization of competing objectives, or proceed to the Uncertainty Quantification tutorial to learn about statistical analysis techniques.

For a comprehensive workflow, the combination of MOGA optimization for design discovery, RSM for detailed analysis, and UQ for robustness assessment provides complete Model Intelligence capabilities for advanced bioelectronic device development.

Both tutorials use the same underlying simulation model but demonstrate different analysis approaches, showing how the same data can provide complementary insights depending on your analysis objectives.
