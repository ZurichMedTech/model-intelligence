# Customizing a Plugin

The first step in customizing your Sim4Life plugin is to create a Simulation class. This class defines the core logic and behavior of your simulation plugin.

## Creating a Simulation Class

To create your simulation class, implement it in the `model/simulation.py` file of your plugin. This class should inherit from the appropriate base class and define the simulation parameters, logic, and any custom methods required for your physics model.

For more details and examples, see the [Creating a Simulation Class](creating-simulation.md) guide.
